# Shape-Collision-Detection (C-Rigidbodies)

Minimal 2D rigid-body collision detection in C.

This repository contains simple geometric collision detection routines for:

- Circle–circle collisions
- Circle–line collisions
- Line–line collisions

All implemented from first principles using linear/vector algebra.  
This is **not** a full physics engine: no constraint resolution, gravity, or impulse handling.  
It is a small side experiment written for fun.
